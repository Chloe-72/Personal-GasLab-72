## Anti-Fragile Experiment
- If I ship crap or go silent for 3 days, I burn 0.1 ETH as a laziness penalty.
- Every commit is minted as an on-chain SBT â€” irreversible work proof.
- Welcome to audit, attack, CR. Knives welcome.

## Anti-Fragile Contract
```solidity
function forceRest() external view returns (bool) {
    return block.timestamp - lastCommit > 3 days;
}
