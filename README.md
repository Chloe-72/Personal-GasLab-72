# Anti-Fragile Web3 Journey

On-chain, non-reversible, 148-day public build of an anti-fragile DeFi protocol.

## On-Chain Clock
Tx Hash: 5602662 (Git snapshot, irreversible)

## Anti-Fragile Experiment
- If I ship crap or go silent for 3 days, I burn 0.1 ETH as a laziness penalty.
- Every commit is minted as an on-chain SBT — irreversible work proof.
- Welcome to audit, attack, CR. Knives welcome.

## On-Chain Deliverables (148 days)
| Day | Insight | Gas Saved | Chain Proof |
|---|---------|-----------|-------------|
| 001 | AddressSkeleton baseline | 2.1k | https://github.com/Chloe-72/Personal-GasLab-72/commit/5602662 |
| 002 | D2 SBT Stage-0 draft + SHA-256 commit | 0 | https://x.com/chloecao0702/status/1976316792554631352 |
| 003 | Insight   | Anti-Fragile SBT v1.0.0 off-chain compile → bytecode match (not deployed yet). |
| Gas Used  | TBD (will update after deploy) |
| Chain Proof | TBD (will update after deploy) |
| Evidence  | • Source: https://gist.github.com/Chloe-72/3ec1a4fb7b7f83f2d57c63a59305a80d<br>• Bytecode: https://gist.github.com/Chloe-72/0d8ab0b6dcd7b9f037c8b8e52da8b8bf<br>• Metadata JSON: https://gist.github.com/Chloe-72/b6d7b738f69d2a5c1b6b1b6b1b6b1b6b<br>• keccak-256: `0x532eda454d1bff0ebca0446c372a812e236e8b010c16630e37ed98c97d1cf818` |
| Learning  | • Offline compilation beats Remix network hiccups.<br>• One-line fix (`_exists` → `ownerOf`) keeps hash intact.<br>• Public commitment stays immutable as long as hash remains. |
| On-Chain Tx Hash | TBD |
